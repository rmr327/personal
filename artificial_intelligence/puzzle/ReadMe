The purpose of this program is to populate an m*n empty grid with words from a list using the flailing wildly strategy

To run the code and get the out put in a .TXT file run the following command in a terminal
from the source code directory:

python3 puzzle_rmr327.py > result.txt

Each function in the source code is well documented to explain its inputs, outputs and functionality.

Result files 1, 2, 3, 5 all display results of successful (All words were placed in grid) runs of the program.

Result file 4 display an unsuccessful (Rand out of options) run of the program.

Each file prints in the following way:
    iteration 1:
        describe current state
        describe each applicable rule in a list format
        describe which rule was chose
    iteration 2:
        describe current state
        describe each applicable rule in a list format
        describe which rule was chose
    .
    .
    .
    .
    iteration N:
    describe current state
    describe each applicable rule in a list format
    describe which rule was chose

    print if successful or ran out of choices

    if successful:
        print final state
        print final state with all empty cells of the grid filled in with random letters
